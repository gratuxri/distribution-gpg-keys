# don't forget you have to change the version of debhelper according to the system where you compile the package
# also remember that some older version uses debhelper and not debhelper-compat
# to know your version of debhelper
# quite simply
# apt-get -y install debhelper
# and those even if the package and already installed would get you a response like this
# debhelper is already the newest version (13.6ubuntu1).
# here the version is 13.6 so we put 13
